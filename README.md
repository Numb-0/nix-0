# nix-0
A simple ***‚ùÑ NixOs configuration ‚ùÑ*** using [**Hyrpland**](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) and [**Ags**](https://github.com/Aylur/ags) themed using [**Stylix**](https://github.com/danth/stylix) and [**Catppuccin Macchiato**](https://catppuccin.com/palette) colors.

# Installation
1. **Clone the repository** in the home directory or where you want:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Numb-0/nix-0.git ~/nix-0
```
2. **Navigate to directory**
```bash
cd ~/nix-0
```
3. **Apply flake configuration**
```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#nixos
```
> [!TIP]
> Make sure you have NixOS installed and flakes enabled before proceeding. If you encounter any issues, refer to the NixOS documentation. üìö

# Ags
The **Ags** application is tightly integrated with **Hyprland** using it's module. If you're using another window manager (WM), most of its features **won't work**.

For example:
- **Hyprland keybinds** are used to hide/show different windows of the Ags application.  
If you're not using Hyprland, this functionality will **not be available**.
The wifi module is **not** implemented yet!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I've recently migrated from **GTK3** to the **GTK4** version of **Ags**. As a result, there might be some **unintended behavior** that I haven't discovered yet.  
>  
> üö® **Proceed with caution** and feel free to report any quirks you encounter!

# Personalization

To customize the configuration, you can modify the values in the **[variables.nix](hosts/nixos/variables.nix)** file.  
This file contains variables that are used to set options across different parts of the configuration, such as:

- **Hyprland**
- **Git**
- And more...

> [!WARNING]
> **Not all settings are controlled by variables!**  
> Most options are manually defined in the **[config.nix](hosts/nixos/config.nix)** file, so make sure to check there as well. üõ†Ô∏è

# Docs
> [!NOTE]
> The **`docs` folder** currently contains information about **commands** and **Nix**, but **not** the configuration.

> üöß **This is still a work in progress**
