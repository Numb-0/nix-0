# Installation

git clone https://github.com/Numb-0/nix-0.git ~/nix-0
```
2. **Navigate to directory**
```bash
cd ~/nix-0
```
3. **Apply flake configuration**

> Make sure you have NixOS installed and flakes enabled before proceeding. If you encounter any > > issues, refer to the NixOS documentation. üìö
# Ags
The **Ags** application is tightly integrated with **Hyprland** using it's module. If you're using another window manager (WM), most of its features **won't work**.

For example:
- **Hyprland keybinds** are used to hide/show different windows of the Ags application.  
  If you're not using Hyprland, this functionality will **not be available**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I've recently migrated from **GTK3** to the **GTK4** version of **Ags**. As a result, there might be some **unintended behavior** that I haven't discovered yet.  
>  
> üö® **Proceed with caution** and feel free to report any quirks you encounter! üõ†Ô∏è

# Personalization
Some of the configuration values are in the [variables.nix](hosts/nixos/variables.nix) file.
The file contains variables that are used to set options in different part of the configuration like hyprland, git and others.

> [!WARNING] 
> Not all the settings are covered by variables, some options have been manually written in [config.nix](hosts/nixos/config.nix)!

# Docs
> [!NOTE]
> The **`docs` folder** currently contains information about **commands** and **Nix**, but **not** the configuration.  
>  
> üöß **This is still a work in progress**
